 ⚠ Memory debugging mode is enabled. Note: This will affect performance.
    - Heap snapshots will be automatically generated when the process reaches more than 70% of the memory limit and again when the process is just about to run out of memory.
    - To manually generate a heap snapshot, send the process a SIGUSR2 signal: `kill -SIGUSR2 27890`
    - Heap snapshots when there is high memory will take a very long time to complete and may be difficult to analyze in tools.
    - See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/memory-usage for more information.
